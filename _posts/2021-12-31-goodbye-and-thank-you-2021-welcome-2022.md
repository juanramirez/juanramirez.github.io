excerpt: "2021 has been the year when I started to accept (and even celebrate!) my new status as ABI affected (and survivor). It's not a little thing. ABI is shocking for anyone who suffers from it, but it can be also the beginning of a different, new and better (yes, better!) life. 2022 should be the year when I can consider myself more or less _recovered_ from my ABI and be able to return to more or less _normal life_.

2021 has been the year when I started to accept (and even celebrate!) my new status as ABI affected (and survivor). It's not a little thing. **ABI is shocking** for anyone who suffers from it, but it can also be the beginning of a different, new and better (yes, **better**!) life. A life where one can learn to identify his or her weaknesses and strenghts, how to transform weaknesses into strenghts and how to use the latter to compensate the former.

**I'm thankful because I'm alive** and because, during this year, I learned a lot of ways to overcome obstacles in my life and to be **a better human being** after all.

2021 has been a _transition year_. During this year I started to be more independent. I started, somehow, **to be me again**. I hope 2022 to be the year when I can start to consider myself _recovered_ from my ABI (at least when I can consider my rehabilitation more or less _over_) and when I can return to more or less _normal life_. Yes, I know I'm different after all this, but someway **we're always different** as time doesn't stops and every experience makes us different.

Next year should be the year when I hopefully __just go on with my life__ after this really overwhelming experience. I know it will not be exactly the same as before, but I want to think that _it doesn't really matter so much_ since I don't really remember so exactly how my life was in the past ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

So let's go on! I wish you everyone a **happy 2022!** :)
