![Welcome!](/assets/images/posts/hello-and-welcome.jpg)

Hello and welcome! I'm Juan Ramírez, a 37-year-old software developer working at [Telefónica](http://www.telefonica.com) (but now on sick leave). I was born in [Cádiz](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cadiz). For years I lived in [Chiclana](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chiclana), [Cádiz](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cadiz), [Granada](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Granada) and [Madrid](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Madrid), but now I live in [Ronda](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ronda) (all of them, except Madrid, are cities in [Andalusia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Andalusia), Spain).

I decided to write this blog in March 2021 after suffering a **brain surgery** a year before, as a way to share my personal experience as [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_brain_injury) affected, and also as a way to test my English skills after that.
Please consider this blog __in development__ for the moment (I hope to be able to remove this sentence someday).

~~_I seem to remember_ (I use **a lot** this expression now) that in the past I had a different blog somewhere, but I just couldn't find it.~~ (I've crossed out this text because I already found the posts of my old development blog and I'm gonna add them here with their original date). I think that this could be related to my memory problems. Following the latest report from my [neuropsychologyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychology), I have two different kinds of memory sequels after the process:

a) I can't remember a lot of things which happened or which I learned **before** the process, especially in the latest 3-4 years before (this seems to be called [retrograde amnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_amnesia), and

b) I also have difficulties when trying to learn **new** things (this seems to be called [anterograde amnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterograde_amnesia)).

You could be thinking that, if the tumor was benign and if it wasn't located in the encephalon (which is where most important parts of the brain are), it shouldn't had to be removed and I shouldn't have any sequel. Well, what I understand is that it had to be removed because it was so big that it was compressing the [cerebrospinal fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid) in my head (that's also the reason why it was producing me strange headaches and the reason why it was detected).
The sequels are there because surgeons had to make a __tunnel__ through the encephalon to access the space where the tumor was and remove it. The [encephalon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalon) is like a __shell__ in our brain which surrounds spaces called [ventricles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_system) which normally contains cerebrospinal fluid, although most important parts of the brain are there in the encephalon.

Nowadays, I undergo a rehabilitation process [in Granada](https://www.aisse.coop/centro-sinergia), so I'm still trying to learn some ways to deal with my sequels without compromising all my life. For instance, I always carry a little notebook in my pocket which I use to take notes about almost __everything__ I did in my day. But the way of using that notebook changed some weeks ago because my neuropsychologyst recommended extending the periods without writing on it to exercise my memory. From now on, I have to collect those __daily things__ from time to time and write them down on those specific moments. I suppose it's a way of transitioning to not having to use it at all someday, at least for those __daily things__.

At a first moment, I also had physical rehab, because each side of the brain controls physical feelings and movements of the opposite part of the body. The first weeks after my surgery I had [hemiparesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiparesis) (the left part of my body was paralysed, because surgeons accessed my brain through the right part of my head). Happily, nowadays that is completely recovered and I even retook [my running workouts](https://www.strava.com/athletes/316725) (with some special precautions).

This is intended to be both a _personal_ and a _development_ blog, so I'll write here both about __personal things__ (including ABI and neurological rehab) and __software development__. At first, as my life turns all around rehab now, I'll write **a lot** about ABI and neurological rehab, from the point of view of a patient who __receives__ a treatment, and about how I feel my life has changed since a year ago. Anyway, in the future I expect to write about a lot of different topics.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
