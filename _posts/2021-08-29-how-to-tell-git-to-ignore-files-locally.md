**Note:** This post has been recovered from my archive after having been lost [due to my brain injury](http://localhost:4000/abi/about-me/hello-and-welcome/). It was originally posted in my old development blog on August 1st, 2017.

Excluding files for being versioned in Git is easy [through the use of the widely known `.gitignore` file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

This `.gitignore` file is normally **versioned**.

That's _clever_, because most software sources will generate binaries or intermediate code when being run or compiled. Also, if you're working in a virtual environment (Python [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io), for instance) or with a package manager ([`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/), for instance), you'll likely have your project dependencies in a directory inside your repo.

Adding those generated files or directories in `.gitignore` will benefit everyone involved in the project, because having git ignoring them will prevent people to _add_ those files to the project, so those files will be autogenerated uniquely for each one.

**By the way:** You can place multiple `.gitignore` files, inside each directory, to establish directory-specific rules.

## So why in the world would we want to exclude files _only for us_?
Well, there may be several reasons.

First (and this is a very typical case), imagine you have generated **files that are specific to your IDE or your OS**. Typical examples are `.DS_Store` files on MacOS, the `.idea` directory generated by Jetbrains IDEs and `*~` backup files created by `vim`.

Why would someone who uses Atom on Linux want to mess out with those lines on the common `.gitignore` file? Should we cover there every file name pattern for every IDE/OS/environment in the world? It doesn't seem a good idea, don't you think? In addition, you could come up with a conflict with some editor which uses a pattern that matches a file that needs to be versioned.

Second, maybe you want to use a **special file or directory in the project to store something**, but, the same as before, it's something other people don't have to mess out with. Maybe you want to use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) but not everybody involved in the project is gonna use it. Or, for example, I usually create a directory called `.snippets` on each project, where I store... well, code snippets, to have them always located.

To ignore these kind of files locally, I'll explain two different methods:

### Method #1: `core.excludesFile`
To apply this method, create a file named as you want (for example, `~/.gitignore_global`) and specify its path in the _git_ global config variable `core.excludesFile`

This method makes git ignore files in **all local repositories**. This makes this method ideal for ignoring _environment generated_ files, but maybe not for _project-specific_ files. If you want to ignore some files only for one project, you'd better make use of the second method.
{: .notice--warning}

For example, we're going to create a file `~/.gitignore_global`. Please note that, on this context, _global_ means that we're going to use these exclusions for all our repositories in our machine, but nobody will know it outside of our environment, so in some sense it will be also _local_.

So, we create the file to ignore, for example, MacOS `.DS_Store` files and Jetbrains `.idea` directories. The pattern syntax is the same as the one used with `.gitignore`:

{% capture code %}
.DS_Store
.idea/
{% endcapture %}

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading"><code>.gitignore_global</code></div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    {% highlight conf linenos %}{{code}}{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

Now we have to tell `git` that we want to use that file as `excludesFile`:
~~~ shell
$ git config --global core.excludesFile ~/.gitignore_global
~~~

### Method #2: `.git/info/exclude`
This method is also [widely documented](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). In every git repository, we have a special file `.git/info/exclude` where we can add the patterns we want to exclude locally.

This `.git/info/exclude` file is **unique** for each repository. This makes this method ideal for _project-specific_ files or directories. Anyway, we could use a symlink to a file in our home directory, for example.
{: .notice--warning}

Again, the same pattern syntax applies:
{% capture code %}
.env
.nvmrc
{% endcapture %}

<div class="panel panel-default">
  <div class="panel-heading"><code>.git/info/exclude</code></div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    {% highlight conf linenos %}{{code}}{% endhighlight %}
  </div>
</div>

This way, `git` won't alert you about those files having changes on the repo, and nobody will have to know about your `.env` variables or the Node version you configured on `.nvmrc` (and you won't overwrite files on your teammates repos).
